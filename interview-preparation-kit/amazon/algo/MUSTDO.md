Start with the questions which are tagged easy. Keep a goal of solving 5 questions daily, if you are not able to solve 5 in a day, reduce it to 2-3 questions. In the same way, you can increase the count to 8-10 questions daily. Make sure you remember your approach and try to explore more approaches available for that question.

A must do list according to me:
(these are some of the easy questions - once your solution gets accepted, leetcode shows you suggestion for next similar questions, you can solve them too rather than following this list.)
