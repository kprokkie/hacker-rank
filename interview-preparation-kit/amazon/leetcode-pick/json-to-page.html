<!--
    Given a JSON object, build a page of items from that JSON that meets specific design parameters 
    (4 items per row, color of title, border, margins, padding all according to spec). 
    
    The spec was ugly, IMO, but whatever... I was given the design specs and was not interviewing as a designer, but as a developer. 
    Requirements included fading images in/out on mouseover, delete an item from the list, undo a deletion, etc. 
    Additional features included sprite display from an Amazon-provided spritesheet for showing the number of stars on reviews. 
    All in all, it was a pretty good mix of tasks that a front end developer would be required to do on a day-to-day basis.
